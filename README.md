Homework week 1


1. For this homework assignment, I updated the html code to semantic html, including replacing the generic <code>div</code> tags with <code>header</code>, <code>main</code>, <code>section</code>, <code>aside</code>, and <code>article</code>. I also added an <code>alt</code> for each image on the website.
